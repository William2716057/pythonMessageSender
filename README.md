Socket Server and Client Communication
This repository contains a simple Python script for creating a socket server and sending messages to it using a client.

How to Use
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

Usage
Navigate to the cloned directory:

Open the Python script socket_server.py in your preferred text editor.

Adjust the target IP address and port in the if __name__ == "__main__": block to match your configuration.
